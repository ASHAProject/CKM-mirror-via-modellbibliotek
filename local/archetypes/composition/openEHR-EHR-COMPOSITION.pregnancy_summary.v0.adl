Multiple Pregnancy Summary COMPOSITIONS may co-exist in a woman's health record - one per pregnancy.

The intent of this COMPOSITION is for use as a persistent summary, however it has been identified that for implementation the archetype also needs additional attributes related to the context of the event. As a result, the COMPOSITION has been temporarily modified as an EVENT COMPOSITION which allows addition of an Items SLOT into which additional context-related archetypes can be included. This new requirement for context-related attributes in the Persistent COMPOSITION has been requested as a future openEHR Reference Model update.">
