This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.family_history or to provide the structure for a family history within documents, such as a discharge summary or referral.

This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
- a statement about the positive presence of family history issues can be recorded using a single instance of the EVALUATION.family_history; OR
- statements about the positive exclusion of family history issue can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global ; OR
- statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of family history issue nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
