In many clinical situations, there are 'Not For Resuscitation' or 'Do not attempt resuscitation' orders in place, recorded in clinical records. 

The assumed default is that the patient should be resuscitated as clinically appropriate. This archetype has been designed to explicitly record 'No limitation of treatment' as default. Any alteration to this is also recorded explicitly in the health record. It is also possible to record specific limitations on treatment, for example allowing IV fluids and antibiotics only.

In keeping with recent trends, the 'Status' value set comprises 'No limitation of treatment' (for full resuscitation measures), 'Allow natural death' (for no active resuscitation measures, with the exception of treatments providing comfort) and the specification of treatment limitations at a category level.

The 'Limitation of treatment' information contained in this archetype should be aligned with an Advanced Care Directive, initiated by the patient or carers, wherever possible.">
