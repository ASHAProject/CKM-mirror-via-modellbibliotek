			purpose = <"To record a clinical treatment, test or procedure which should not be provided to or performed on the individual.">
			use = <"Use to record the identification of a treatment, test or procedure which should not be provided to, or performed on, an individual due to the likely or possible direct clinical effect on the individual. Please note: this archetype may also be used in uncommon situations where there is a need to record a contraindication for a treatment, test or procedure that should not be provided to, or performed on, the individual because of likely or possible harmful effects on another individual - for example, live vaccines should not be given to an individual if they have a family member who is immunosuppressed.

This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for any relevant therapeutic precautions as a clinician commences a new treatment, test or procedure for a subject of care.

It is possible for a contraindication to be created in the record of the subject of care, even though the undesired clinical effect may be on others and not directly on the subject of care themselves. For example: live vaccines should not be administered to individuals who have family members in an immunosuppressed state or actively taking immunosuppressive therapy as the family member may be at significant risk of contracting the infectious disease.

This contraindication may be identified in a number of ways including, but not limited to: 
- previous experience of a procedure being performed and subsequent clinical assessment that this should not be repeated; 
- implantation of a metal device which precludes some imaging examinations
- genomic test results that indicate an adverse event may take place if a treatment or medication is administered; or
- adverse experience by a family member to a similar treatment, medication or procedure.

In the case of medications or vaccines, this archetype complements the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype by identifying other reasons why a medication or vaccine should not be administered, other than an adverse reaction. In view of this, clinical decision support for prescribing should include reference to this archetype plus the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk as part of a safe prescribing process.">
