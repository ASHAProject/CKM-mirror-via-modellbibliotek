This archetype has been designed to ensure that all differential diagnoses are recorded using a single model. In a clinical system, it would be expected that each differential diagnosis would be recorded using a separate instance of the 'Per differential' cluster.

Each differential diagnosis should be regarded as a temporary hypothesis for a possible diagnosis and should only be used in the earliest phases of the diagnostic process. In practice, clinicians may identify a list of one or more differential diagnoses, any one of which may explain the clinical presentation. As more information is gathered from examination, diagnostic test results, or referrals, the list of differential diagnoses is gradually refined and outliers eliminated until one or more working, provisional, or preliminary diagnosis is determined. If a differential diagnosis is accepted as a likely diagnosis, it is anticipated that it will be formally entered into the health record as a Problem/Diagnosis using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype, with the CLUSTER.problem_qualifier archetype potentially nested within the Problem/Diagnosis archetype to annotate the diagnosis as 'working' or 'preliminary'.
