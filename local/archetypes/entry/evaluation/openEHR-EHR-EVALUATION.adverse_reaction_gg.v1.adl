			purpose = <"openEHR:
To record information about any harmful, desirable or unexpected reaction to a substance or agent, including:
- immune mediated reactions Types I-IV (including true allergic reactions and hypersensitivities), and 
- non-immune mediated reactions (including pseudoallergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, drug toxicities (eg Gentamicin), drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and idiosyncratic reactions).

To record information about previous exposures to a substance, allowing a persisting and evolving summary of adverse reaction events to build up over time.

To record additional information that will support and inform a clinical assessment of the propensity of an individual to experience an adverse reaction if exposed to a specific substance, class of substance or agent in the future.

FHIR: 
Allergy/Intolerance resources are used to provide information about adverse sensitivities to substances that lead to physiologic changes that are clinically observable. An adverse sensitivity is defined as:

A condition expected to result in undesirable physiologic reaction to an amount of a substance that would not produce a reaction in most individuals. The substance is the trigger of an immunologic response that produces the observed physiologic changes, or in some instances nonimmunologic mechanisms that produce clinically identical physiologic changes. The immunologic response might be considered the actual cause of the reaction, but it is exposure to the trigger substance that is clinically observable.

This definition excludes clinically identical episodes that may be caused by physical agents, such as heat, cold, sunlight, or vibration, by exercise activity, or by infectious agents. Those conditions caused by physical agents or infectious would be captured on the problem list (List/Condition Resources). The allergy/intolerance list is a list of conditions that represent a propensity unique to this individual for a reaction upon future exposure to a specified substance.

Note that this specification draws a distinction between the patients condition/problem list and an allergy/intolerance list, even though allergies and intolerances are also conditions. This is because the distinction is a long established clinical workflow, even to patients. Asking an individual \"if they have any problems\" is not going to invoke an account of their past reactions to medications or foods. Instead, they are asked if they \"have any allergies\". An allergy/intolerance is also different in that a potential harm from exposure to an external substance that may be ordered by a provider in the course of their care but is not inherent to exposure to that substance for the general population.">
			use = <"openEHR:
Use to record all information about the presence of adverse reaction/s (including an allergic reaction/s)  to a substance to support direct clinical care of an individual; as part of a managed Adverse Reaction list; to enable safe exchange of information about adverse reactions; and to assist computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

Use to provide a single place within the health record to record a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions, including:  
-  record cumulative information about each exposure to a known substance, class of substance or agent; and 
-  record a clinician's opinion that administration of, or exposure to, a substance or agent is absolutely contraindicated.

This archetype has been designed to allow recording of information about a more generic substance, class of substance or agent, and then allow more specific details to be recorded including identification of the specific substance on a per exposure basis, including links to other parts of the health record where further details may be located. Note:  it is possible on second or subsequent exposures to a previously identified substance for a reaction not to occur and this archetype allows for these events to be closely linked in a way that will assist in determining if the adverse reaction has been incorrectly identified.

Design of this archetype has been deliberatly focused on identifying a pragmatic, core data set that will be suitable for most common use clinical scenarios but permits extension of the model when additional detail is required through incorporation of additional archetypes in the 'Additional Reaction Detail', 'Additional Exposure Detail', and 'Reporting Details' slots. Examples of clinical situations where the extension will be required are for a detailed immunology assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or clinical trial use.

A data element for Substance Category has not been modelled as this should be able to be derived from any coded entry for Substance/Agent and be used in decision support activities. A coded Category is not adequate to support decision support if Substance/Agent is only entered via free text.

The act of recording an adverse reaction in the health record implies there is a potential hazard for the individual if they are exposed to the same substance/agent in the future - a relative contraindication. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/agent again, for example, following a manifestation of anaphylaxis, the 'Absolute contraindication' data flag should be recorded as ‘True’. Note: Conversely, a statement about ‘Severity’ of propensity (with possible values such as Mild, Moderate and Severe) has deliberately not been modelled explicitly. Predicting or estimating the grade of possible severity of a future reaction is not safe to record and persist in data, except where it is absolutely clear that the risk of deliberate re-exposure is unacceptable and highly likely to cause significant harm, such as a previous manifestation of anaphylaxis, and in this case the ‘Absolute contraindication’ data flag should be used. 

Valuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:
- statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure,
- source of the information/reporter, and
- a flag for absolute contra-indication. 
Second-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.

A formal Adverse Reaction Report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details of the adverse reaction. The report will be comprised of this Adverse Reaction archetype plus a variable number of others - for example, demographics, weight, medication and problem/diagnosis.

FHIR:

Most of the details of the sensitivity can be found in the set of reactions that are associated with the resource, though these may not be present when the patient has not provided enough information. Adverse Reactions do not have to be always associated with an AllergyIntolerance which may appropriate when an single reaction has not provided enough evidence for a meaningful Allergy/Intolerance, or in specific views of events rather than in a general clinical record.">

Not to be used for recording the absence (or negative presence) of a reaction to 'any substances' or to identified substances – use the EVALUATION.exclusion family of archetypes to express a positive statement of Adverse Reaction exclusion.

Not to be used for recording that no information was able to be obtained about the Adverse Reaction status of a patient. Use the EVALUATION.absent_information family of archetypes to record that a positive statement that information was not able to be obtained, for example, if a non-cooperative patient refuses to answer questions.

Not to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example: abnormal use or mistakes/errors made in administration of an agent or substance; mislabelling; harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure; overdose etc.

4.1.2 Background and Context
An Adverse Reaction normally has a set of signs or symptoms that are reported in the Symptom class. However, it is possible to convey that an adverse reaction occurred without knowing the specific signs or symptoms that occurred, e.g. Some unknown reaction occurred. Similarly, it is possible to convey that an adverse reaction with a set of symptoms occurred but not indicate the substance if it is not known. e.g. A rash occurred for some unknown reason.

The Exposure class is used to indicate a set of exposures that preceded the reaction. There is no assertion of causality, purely a statement of timing. Each exposure can indicate a substance that might be different from the reaction if needed.">
