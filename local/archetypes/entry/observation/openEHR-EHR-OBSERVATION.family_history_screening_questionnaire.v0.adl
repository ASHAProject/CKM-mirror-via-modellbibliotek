Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:
--- Is there any known diseases in the family?
--- Is there a history of heart disease in the family?
--- Did your mother have diabetes?
- Specific questioning related to chronic disease management or preventive health.

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a significant health-related problem the familiy at any time in the past and information about  a significant health-related problem the familiy in a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Have any family members COVID now?\" compared to \"Have any familymembers had COVID the past 4 weeks?\"

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a significant health-related problem, it is recommended that the clinical system record and persist the specific details about the significant health-related problem using the EVALUATION.family_history archetype.
