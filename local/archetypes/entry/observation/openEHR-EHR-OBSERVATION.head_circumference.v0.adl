This archetype can also be used for recording an approximation of the head circumference measurement in a clinical scenario where it is not possible to measure an accurate height or length - for example, measuring an uncooperative child. This is not modelled explicitly in the archetype as the openEHR Reference model allows the attribute of Approximation for any Quantity data type. At implementation, for example, an application user interface could allow clinicians to select an appropriately labelled check box adjacent to the Height data field to indicate that the recorded height is an approximation, rather than actual.A statement identifying the physical incompleteness of the head can be recorded in the 'Confounding factors' protocol element, if required.

Use to record growth from repeated measurements. This can currently be modelled by constraining the 'any event' to an interval in a template with associated mathematical function of increase, as appropriate.">

Not to be used to record the circumference of another body part. Use OBSERVATION.body_segment in these circumstances except where more specific archetypes exist such as OBSERVATION.waist_hip.">
