			use = <"*Use to record a statement or declaration about the pregnancy status of the individual at a specific point in time. A clinical assertion about whether a pregnancy is present, excluded or possible is clinically important in some clinical scenarios, such as guiding management decisions which may cause harm to a pregnant woman or the fetus in an unrecognised pregnancy.

While the presence of a known pregnancy can often be safely assumed or inferred from other routinely recorded data in the health record, clinical practice typically presumes that a woman of child-bearing age may be pregnant until proven otherwise and the ability to record uncertainty regarding the possibility of the individual being pregnant. In some clinical scenarios, excluding the presence of a pregnancy is necessary and carries significant clinical safety and medicolegal implications.  

Absolute exclusion of pregnancy is possible only in limited cases, such as after the confirmed surgical removal of both ovaries and the uterus. In most other situations, clinicians are required to assert a pregnancy exclusion based on a combination of current clinical assessments and judgment. This exclusion should include the clinician’s rationale or justification, which may reference contemporaneous test results, an organ inventory or a past history of diagnoses and procedures.

It is crucial to note that any assertion of pregnancy exclusion in the health record is usually relevant only at the time it is documented. (en)">
