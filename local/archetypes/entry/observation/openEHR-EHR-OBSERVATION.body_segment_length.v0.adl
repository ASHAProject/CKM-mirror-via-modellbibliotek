This measurement may be recorded and tracked over time, for example tracking child growth parameters, or used to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body for purposes of clinical or anthropometric assessment.

Common measured parameters that are recorded using units of length will be added to the DV_CODED_TEXT data type in the 'Body segment' data element. As further parameters are identified, these can be added to this list over time.">
