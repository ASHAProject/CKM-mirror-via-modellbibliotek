However if this single boolean is exchanged to a location where the assumed language is different, the recorded boolean may be incorrect. In order for this data to be correctly exchanged, both the language and requirement for translation needs to be exchanged as a pair. Each language spoken by an individual will require a separate assessment of whether a translator is required.">
