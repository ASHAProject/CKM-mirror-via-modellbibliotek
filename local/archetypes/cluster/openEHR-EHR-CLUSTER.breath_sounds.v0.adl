			use = <"Use to record a narrative description and clinical interpretation of the findings observed during the auscultation of breath sounds in the body site, which is identified in the parent archetype in which this archetype is nested.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the CLUSTER.exam-lung in which the specific body site is already identified (for example, left lower lobe) or the CLUSTER.exam-abdomen archetype. It can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom_sign.">
