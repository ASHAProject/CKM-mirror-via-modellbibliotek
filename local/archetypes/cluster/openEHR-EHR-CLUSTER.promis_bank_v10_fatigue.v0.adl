This archetype has been designed to be used within the OBSERVATION.promis archetype, and along with other PROMIS bank archetypes constrained to represent a specific PROMIS profile such as PROMIS-29.

The archetype is incomplete at initial modelling, and should be grown as additional items from the relevant item bank are required.
