The scope of this archetype has been constrained to carry only the commonest structured components for identifying a specific physical building or landmark.  In this context a complete address may be described using:
- One or more free text 'Address line' data elements to represent the huge variety of ways that ‘street-level' details may need to be recorded; and
- 'Town' to represent a suburb, town, city, village, or community;
- 'District/County';
- 'State/Territory/Province’;
- ‘Postcode’, and 
- ‘Country'.
