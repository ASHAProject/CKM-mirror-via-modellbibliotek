In most simple clinical recording use cases, the unstructured 'Name' element within the CLUSTER.person archetype will be sufficient to record the name of an individual as part of a health record. However, in circumstances where a structured name is necessary or desirable for clinical recording purposes, nest this archetype within the 'Structured name' SLOT in CLUSTER.person archetype.

Each data element can be entered as a string of free text - for example, 'Prof Dr', 'Sonja Jane', 'Smith-Brown', 'MP'. Alternatively, as each data element is repeatable within a template:
- 'Title' could be cloned to 'Title 1' for the value 'Prof' and 'Title 2' for the value 'Dr'; and
-  'Given name' could be cloned and renamed to 'First name' for the value 'Sonja' and 'Middle name' for the value 'Jane'.

While this archetype has been aligned with ISO 22220, preferred name, name usage, valid dates and the repeating Name component/Order grouping has intentionally not been replicated due to the reduced scope of this archetype.

ISO 22220:2007 (Annex F) provides examples and guidance for how to record complex names within this structured name pattern, including:
- Family name first, given name/s last;
- Family names with prefixes eg El Haddad or van der Heyden; and
- Names containing both father's and mother's family names. (en)">
