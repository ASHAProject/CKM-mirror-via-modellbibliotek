This archetype has been designed to be nested within the 'Structured name' SLOT in CLUSTER.person - to extend it when finer-grained detail is required for completion of the 'Name line' element.

Each component can be entered as free text - for example, 'Ms', 'Sonja Jane', 'Smith Brown', 'MP'. Alternatively, run-time name constraints for each name component allows the order of the components to be specified, such as situations were there are multiple given names or a combination of one or more given names and middle names within the 'Given name' data element. For example 'First given name' as 'Sonja' and 'Second given name' as 'Jane'.">
