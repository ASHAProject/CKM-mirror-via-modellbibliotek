This archetype has been designed to be used in the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result archetype or the CLUSTER.exam_findings-scrotum, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT within this archetype to record additional nested levels of structured imaging findings for related body substructures.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings outside the specified body structure or region. Use other archetypes from the CLUSTER.imaging_exam family for this purpose.

Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
