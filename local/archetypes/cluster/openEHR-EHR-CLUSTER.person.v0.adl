- the copyholder of an advanced care record, using the 'Copyholder' SLOT within the EVALUATION.advance_care_directive archetype;
- the role and contact details of a named contact person within an organisation, using the 'Contact person' SLOT within the CLUSTER.organisation archetype;
- details about a relative in a family history record, using the 'Family member details' SLOT within the openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.family_history archetype;

In most simple clinical recording use cases, the unstructured 'Name' element within the CLUSTER.person archetype will be sufficient to record the name of an individual as part of a health record. However, in circumstances where a structured name is necessary or desirable for clinical recording purposes, nest this archetype within the 'Structured name' SLOT in CLUSTER.person archetype. If the CLUSTER.structured_name archetype is nested within the 'Structured name' SLOT, any or all of the data elements can be combined together as a text string and represented in the 'Name' element, as long as they are consistent.
