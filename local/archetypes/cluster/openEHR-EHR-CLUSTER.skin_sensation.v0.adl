This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the CLUSTER.exam-skin, CLUSTER.exam-cutaneous_nerve or CLUSTER.exam-nerve_root archetypes which provide the context for the structure or system that is being examined. This archetype can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes that provide relevant system or structure context, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
