			purpose = <"For recording a narrative description and clinical interpretation of the findings observed during the physical examination of the chest, and to provide a framework in which to nest detailed CLUSTER archetypes, each of which can further describe specific aspects of the chest examination in more detail.">
			use = <"Use to record a narrative description of the overall findings observed during the physical examination of the chest. This initial draft archetype consists only of the core examination pattern data elements (CLUSTER.exam_pattern) and will be expanded over time as specific clinical requirements are identified.

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings - for example, CLUSTER.exam_heart and CLUSTER.exam.lung. In addition, the CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording data not related to the physical examination of the chest.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure or OBSERVATION.imaging_exam.">
