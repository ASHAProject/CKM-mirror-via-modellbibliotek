It is anticipated that this archetype will gradually evolve to include structural features within a dwelling that may be useful in assessing the needs of the individual who lives there, for example the presence of stairs or rails.

This archetype has been designed to be used within the EVALUATION.housing_summary or CLUSTER.housing_record archetypes, but may be used within any other appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype.">

Not to be used to record the physical address where an individual lives - use demographic archetypes for this purpose, or CLUSTER.address if the individual's address needs to be recorded within the health record.">
