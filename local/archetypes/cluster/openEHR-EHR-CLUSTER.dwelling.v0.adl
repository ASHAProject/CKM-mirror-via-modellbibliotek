This archetype has been designed to be used to record attributes of an individual's home that might be used to:
- contribute to identification of aids/supports that might be useful in the home; 
- record modifications or enhancements to support universal access; or
- inform investigations about public health outbreaks.

This archetype has been designed to be used within the EVALUATION.housing_summary or CLUSTER.housing_record archetypes, but may be used within any other appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype. 

If specific measurements or specific details are required, additional archetypes can be nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT.

Compliance with Universal design principles should be recorded in a separate archetype, which may be nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT.">

Not to be used to record information about the dwelling that does not impact on the health or health care needs of an individual. For example, the security access code for a home nurse visit should not be recorded using this archetype.
