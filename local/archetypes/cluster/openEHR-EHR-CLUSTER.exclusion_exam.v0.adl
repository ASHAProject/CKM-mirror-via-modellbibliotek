This archetype has been designed to be used to allow recording of 'no examination was done' at multiple levels of the examination process. Inserting this archetype into the Examination Detail' SLOT within OBSERVATION.exam allows for recording that no physical examination was performed. It follows that inserting this archeytpe into the Details SLOT of any examination-related CLUSTER archetype allows for recording that no physical examination was performed only for the part of examination specified by that archetype.

In particular, this archetype has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about a record of physical examination within the health record.

It is reasonable to assume that if the examination was partially performed, then only data about the examination performed will be recorded. If the examination was difficult to perform, for example an uncooperative patient, then this information can be included in the overall 'Confounding Factors' data element in the root OBSERVATION.exam archetype or in the 'Comment' data element in each examination CLUSTER archetype.">
